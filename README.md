## Pls Note

:warning: This is the first project I have made using Unreal Engine. Looking back at the code, a lot of things can surely be improved and I have been learning many more things in Unreal and C++ since the moment we had had left off development on this game. If work on this project will resume one day again, the code would then definitely experience a major overhaul. :warning:

## Description

A collaborative Unreal project that started back in my fourth semester. It's a local 4 player competitive last <s>man</s> hamster standing game with the intention of extending it with online multiplayer in the future. 

The game should surprise its players with breaking conventions by providing a chaotic yet fun gameplay with various challenges of uncertainty. Specifically, one of the usable items causes your enemy players' key bindings to their four basic abilities to suddenly remap across the controller's face buttons. With one of the abilities being called "self-destruction" that represents the button you should better never press, the controls of your opponents can be turned into your weapon. Furthermore, the map undergoes significant changes to its layout that are triggered incidentally by the playersâ€™ actions.
